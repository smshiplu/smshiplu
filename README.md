# 👋 Hi, I'm [Your Name] — JavaScript Developer on a Mission

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a passionate frontend developer with a growing expertise in JavaScript and React. I love building interactive web applications that are fast, responsive, and user-friendly. My journey started with vanilla JavaScript and has evolved into crafting full-stack experiences using React, Node.js, Express, Firebase, and MongoDB.

## 🚀 What I Build

I've created several projects that reflect my learning and experimentation with modern web technologies:

- **🧠 React Projects** — Dynamic UIs powered by React, with mock Node.js + Express backends to simulate full-stack behavior.
- **🔥 Firebase Integrations** — Real-time data handling and authentication using Firebase for lightweight backend needs.
- **🌐 Full-Stack App with MongoDB** — One of my proudest projects: a fully functional MERN stack app with a real backend hosted on MongoDB Atlas.
